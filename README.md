  Nepali Custom Password Generator (NCPG) is a tool which generates custom wordlists. It 
  generates weak and common wordlists containing nepali names,surnames,places,phone number etc.
  
  NCPG can be used in legal penetration tests like Dictionary attack to check your
  password strength.You can use any password cracking tool like aircrack-ng,JTR etc.
  
  [Built and tested for/in Linux only.]
  
  Three are three modes in NCPG:
  -----------------------------
  
  * Interactive Mode

    NCPG uses [CUPP](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp) for interactive mode. In this mode you
    will be asked some information about victim and generate password using it.
  
  * Dictionary Mode
    
    NCPG contains some dictionaries containing nepali names,castes,places and common passwords.
    I have found many people simply using there names,places etc as a passwordjust by appending 
    something at last. In this mode NCPG generates password by modifying the dictionaries.
    
  * Phone Number Mode
    
    NCPG uses [Crunch](https://github.com/crunchsec/crunch) to generate phone numbers.
    
    I have also found many people using their phone numbers as passwords. In this mode, you can simply
    generate phone numbers of different telecom service like ncell,ntc,sky etc.
    
    Phone numbers have high chance to be password. But, it highly increases the number of wordlists 
    and hence increases the time. It also increases time to generate passwords.
    
    Good News: I got the ncell number pattern for different zones which helps a lot to decrease the number 
    of wordlists. Only Ncell numbers will be generated by default. But, Just by editing settings
    in configuration file you can generate phone number of your wish.
    
  * Common Password Mode
    
    This mode will not appear because it is on by default. In this mode NCPG includes 
    [Some Common Passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:10,000_most_common_passwords) used
    over internet.
 
  
Requirements
------------

  * Python 3
  * Crunch


Quick Start

-------

  Installing NCPG is optional.For easy execution install NCPG,so
  that you can execute NCPG by typing 'ncpg' anywhere in terminal.
  
  You can use third option in NCPG to install or uninstall NCPG
  Or,
  You can install manually.  
  
  Usage:  `sudo bash install.sh --install | --uninstall`
  

Configuration
-------------

  There are no option to configure NCPG within it.So,you have to edit the configuration
  file of NCPG which is 'config.ini' inorder to edit the settings.
  
  You can use your favourite text editor
  Or, 
  You can use second option in NCPG (Uses Nano by default) to reset or edit configuration file. 
  
  Note: You can also just delete the configuration file to reset it.
